# Baby steps
The purpose of this repository is to provide a really simple web-site architecture for my kids to start learning how to code. The repository provides a:

- `HTML` page for content, i.e. the information which you wish to convey.
- `JavaScript` file for functionality, i.e. if you want to manipulate the content in one way or another.
- `CSS` file for styling, i.e. if you want to change the appearance of the content.

... which should be more than enough to get you guys started.

## Software
Before you're able to work with the code, please ensure that you have a computer with the following software (or similar) installed:

- Microsoft "Visual Studio Code" (or similar code editor), with the following extensions:
    - Live Server: Which easily lets you run the project, and enables live-reload (so you don't have to manually reload the browser-window after you have saved changes to your files).
- Git SCM.
- A GUI-client for Git, so that you can easily see/manage your changes. "Visual Studio Code" has a built-in Git GUI-client, but you can also find another, if you prefer (personally, I am very fond of Atlassian "SourceTree").

## Getting started
To get started:

 1. Clone the repository from GitHub. I suggest making a "Development" folder somewhere sensible on your computer, and cloning the repository to there.
 1. Open the folder in "Visual Studio Code".
 1. Click the "go live" to start "Live Server" and run the project in a browser-window.
 1. Right-click and choose "inspect" from the context-menu to launch the browser's "developer tools".
 1. Click the "console" tab to see the output of the JavaScript files.
 1. Start coding, save your files, and see the result in the browser.

 Enjoy.

 Love, Dad
